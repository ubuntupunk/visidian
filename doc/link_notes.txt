YAML PARSING                                               *visidian-yaml-parsing*
The function s:get_yaml_front_matter attempts to use a real YAML parser if 
available (yaml#decode). If not available, it falls back to a simple regex-based 
parser for extracting tags and links.

YAML UPDATES                                               *visidian-yaml-updates*
When updating YAML frontmatter (e.g., when adding links), the 
s:update_yaml_frontmatter function follows a careful process to preserve existing
metadata:

1. Preserves the opening '---' marker
2. Keeps all existing YAML fields (title, tags, status, etc.) unchanged
3. Only updates the 'links' field
4. Preserves the closing '---' marker
5. Maintains all non-YAML content exactly as it was

Example YAML structure (only 'links' field is modified):
>
    ---
    title: Example Note
    tags: [project, notes]
    status: active
    links: [another-note.md, reference.md]  " Only this line is updated
    ---
<

LINKING NOTES                                             *visidian-linking-notes*
s:search_and_link searches through all .md files in the vault for matching tags 
or direct links. Tags are matched if a note in the vault has the same tag.
Direct links are checked by looking if the current file name is listed in 
another note's links section.

NOTES AND BEST PRACTICES                                  *visidian-link-notes*
1. File names in links should be just the file names (without paths) of the 
   Markdown files within the vault
2. Always use the standard YAML frontmatter format with '---' markers
3. Keep YAML content at the top of the file
4. Use consistent formatting for tags and links

Users need to have a YAML parser installed for optimal performance. Without it, 
the fallback method might not handle all YAML nuances correctly.
