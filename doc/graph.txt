VISIDIAN GRAPHING FUNCTIONS                                      *visidian-graph*


DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Visidian graphing functions provide simple tools for visualizing data
within Vim. These functions can generate ASCII line graphs or utilize gnuplot
for more advanced plotting when available.


FUNCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

visidian#graph#DrawLineGraph({data}, {title}) ~
    Draws a simple line graph using ASCII characters.
    - {data}: List of numerical values to plot.
    - {title} (optional): Title for the graph buffer.

    Example:
    >
    call visidian#graph#DrawLineGraph([1, 2, 3], 'My Line Graph')
    <

visidian#graph#PlotData({data}, {title}) ~
    Plots data using gnuplot if available, or falls back to DrawLineGraph.
    - {data}: List of [x, y] pairs to plot.
    - {title} (optional): Title for the graph buffer.

    Example:
    >
    call visidian#graph#PlotData([[0, 1], [1, 2]], 'My Plot')
    <


USAGE IN VISIDIAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The graphing functions are utilized within the Visidian bookmarking system to
provide visual representations of bookmark statistics.

- Line Graph of Total Bookmarks by Category:
  Utilizes visidian#graph#DrawLineGraph to display the number of bookmarks in
each category.

- Time Series Plot of Recent Additions:
  Utilizes visidian#graph#PlotData to show recent additions over time.

- Files and Folders in PARA Regions:
  The function `s:count_para_contents` in `bookmarking.vim` counts the number of files and folders in each PARA region.
  It generates plots to visualize these counts, providing insights into the structure of your PARA organization.
  - Files Plot: Displays the number of files in each PARA region.
  - Folders Plot: Displays the number of folders in each PARA region.

These visualizations are part of the comprehensive statistics report generated by the bookmarking system.
