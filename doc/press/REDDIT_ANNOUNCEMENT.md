[Vim Plugin] Introducing Visidian - An Obsidian-like Personal Knowledge Management System for Vim

Hey Vim enthusiasts! 👋

I'm excited to announce the first release of Visidian, a Vim plugin that brings Obsidian-like Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) functionality to our favorite text editor!

**What is Visidian?**
Visidian is designed for Vim users who want to manage their knowledge base, notes, and tasks directly within Vim. It combines the power of structured organization with the promise of fluid, AI-enhanced knowledge management.

**Key Features:**
- 📝 Markdown-based note-taking system
- 🗂️ Built-in VisidianParaGen folders for optimal PARA method organization
- 🔗 Note interconnection capabilities
- 🎨 Customizable colors for different note categories
- 🔄 Session management

**What Makes Visidian Different?**
We take a hybrid approach to knowledge management:
1. **Start Organized**: We strongly recommend using our VisidianParaGen folders from day one - it's the best way to build a solid foundation for your knowledge base
2. **Future-Proof**: While we emphasize structure now, we're evolving towards treating all notes as a unified, intelligent stack with advanced search and sorting capabilities
3. **AI on the Horizon**: We're working on chat-with-your-notes functionality for future releases!

**Installation**
You can install it using your favorite plugin manager:

Using vim-plug:
```vim
Plug 'yourusername/visidian.vim'
```

Or Vundle:
```vim
Plugin 'yourusername/visidian.vim'
```

**Current Status**
This is an early release that focuses on providing a solid foundation for structured note-taking. While it's already great for daily knowledge management, we're actively working on advanced features that will make your notes even more accessible and actionable.

If you're looking for a Vim-native PKM solution that combines structured organization with the promise of AI-enhanced knowledge management, give Visidian a try! We'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement.

Happy note-taking! 🚀
