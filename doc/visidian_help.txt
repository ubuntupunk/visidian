2. PARA Method                                    *visidian-para*

The PARA method, developed by Tiago Forte, stands for Projects, Areas, 
Resources, and Archives. It's a simple, yet effective way to organize 
information:

- *Projects*: For tasks with a defined goal and deadline.
- *Areas*: Ongoing responsibilities without a deadline.
- *Resources*: Topics of interest or areas of study, not tied to immediate action.
- *Archives*: Completed projects, expired areas, or old resources.

To use PARA in Visidian, run `:VisidianPara` to create these folder structures 
in your vault.

3. Combining GTD with Visidian                    *visidian-gtd*

Getting Things Done (GTD) by David Allen can be seamlessly integrated with 
Visidian:

- **Capture**: Use Visidian to take quick notes or create files for any new 
  ideas or tasks.
- **Clarify**: Review these notes, deciding whether they're actionable or not.
- **Organize**: Place actionable items into Projects or Areas. Non-actionable 
  items can go into Resources or Archives.
- **Reflect**: Use Visidian's dashboard to review your notes regularly, 
  updating your GTD lists.
- **Engage**: Work from your organized notes, moving items through stages 
  like 'Next Actions' or 'Waiting For'.

Combining PARA and GTD:
- Use 'Projects' for GTD projects, breaking them down into tasks within 
  markdown files.
- 'Areas' can represent contexts or areas of focus from GTD.
- 'Resources' for reference material, and 'Archives' for completed or 
  outdated projects.

4. Tips for Using Visidian                        *visidian-tips*

- **Use YAML front matter** effectively to link notes. For instance:

---
tags: [project, tech]
  links:
    - related_note.md
---

- **Regularly review** your dashboard to keep your knowledge base up-to-date.
- **Customize your workflow**: While PARA and GTD are good frameworks, feel free 
to adjust Visidian's structure to match your personal productivity style.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Map commands to shortcuts for efficiency. For example:

nnoremap <leader>d :VisidianDashboard<CR>
nnoremap <leader>n :VisidianNewFile<CR>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Bookmarks

You might want to set up an autocommand to keep track of the last note
whenever you open or save a markdown file:

In vimrc or init.vim place the following:

autocmd BufEnter,BufWritePost *.md call visidian#bookmarking#set_last_note()  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Naming Conventions

- **Note Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions or a date system for your 
notes to make searching and sorting easier.

Remember, Visidian is meant to enhance your productivity, not to be a rigid 
system. Experiment with different setups until you find what works best for you.
